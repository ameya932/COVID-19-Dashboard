# COVID-19 Dashboard

Coronavirus(COVID-19) Data Analysis with Power BI. Here, I am using a live Web API that is returning data in JSON format.

This is a very basic dashboard which provides information about the present COVID-19 situation in the world. We can get information such as confirmed cases, active cases, recovered patients, the recovery rate and also the fatality rate.

It is an interactive dashboard, where you can select any country(s) you want and will be provided with the requested data accordingly. This makes it very easy to use and provides vital information at our fingertips.

You can get the data at https://www.trackcorona.live/api/countries
